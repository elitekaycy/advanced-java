### MicroBlog

In these lab, I design and deploy a microservice-based blog application using Spring Boot and Kubernetes. I explore cloud-native development fundamentals, including scalability and resilience. I architect a microservice solution for the blog application, comprising User Management, Post Service. Through this hands-on experience, I gain a deeper understanding of microservice architecture and cloud-native development principles.
