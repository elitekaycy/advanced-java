# Overview

In these labs, I explore advanced Java concurrency using the Fork/Join framework: I implement Parallel Fibonacci Calculation to compute Fibonacci numbers concurrently, Parallel Summation of an Array for complex array tasks, and Parallel Matrix Multiplication to optimize matrix operations across cores. These exercises provide me with practical experience in leveraging Fork/Join for efficient multi-threaded processing.
