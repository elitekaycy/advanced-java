## Distributed Systems & Big Data (e.g., Apache Spark)

## Overview

I explore Apache Spark and distributed systems, focusing on their role in handling big data challenges efficiently. This README outlines foundational concepts and practical exercises to understand and implement distributed data processing using Apache Spark.

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 1**: [Simulate a basic MapReduce job for word count using an in-memory approach](./labs/wordCountMapReduce/)
2. **Exercise 2 (Advanced)**: [Install Apache Spark, set up a development environment, and write a word count program using Spark's Java API](./labs/apacheSpark/).
