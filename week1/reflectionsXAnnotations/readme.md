## Reflections and Annotations Project Overview

This project dives deep into Java Reflection and Annotations, where I explore dynamic code inspection and manipulation at runtime. I've implemented a @LogExecutionTime annotation to log method execution times and crafted a custom class loader for loading classes from directories. These exercises demonstrate firsthand how reflection empowers dynamic behavior and annotations augment code flexibility and modularity within Java applications.

#### Reflection and Annotation Labs

- <strong>Exercise #1</strong>: [ Create a custom annotation @LogExecutionTime to log the execution time of a method](./logger)
- <strong>Exercise #2</strong>: [Implement a class loader that can load classes from a custom directory at runtime using reflection](./classloader/)
